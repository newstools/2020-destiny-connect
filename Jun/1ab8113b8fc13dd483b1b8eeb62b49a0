Operating from a dedicated space in Lagos, Nigeria, Google’s first regionally-based startup accelerator program, Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, has committed to training 60 African startups over 3 years since its launch in 2017. This has meant over $3-million in equity-free support, working space, travel (pre- COVID-19 pandemic), PR and access to expert advisers from Google, Silicon Valley during each three-month programme. Now the accelerator programme presents “Google for Startups Accelerator Africa Class 5”. Previously called Google Launchpad Accelerator Africa,  Google for Startups Accelerator Africa Class 5 will take place online, as one combined class of 20 startups, rather than the two classes per year held previously. The program will run for the usual 3 months, with a one week ‘virtual bootcamp’ per month, from 29 June until 11 September 2020. <img class=" wp-image-89173 aligncenter" src="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Google-for-Startups-image-300x109.png" alt="" width="510" height="185" srcset="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Google-for-Startups-image-300x109.png 300w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Google-for-Startups-image-360x131.png 360w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Google-for-Startups-image-600x218.png 600w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Google-for-Startups-image.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /> The selected pool of startups for Google for Startups Accelerator Africa Class 5 2020 are from Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.
