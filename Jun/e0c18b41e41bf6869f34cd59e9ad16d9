As the country slowly begins to re-open from the lockdown, we’re all emerging from our caves. It’s time to get out of those well-worn leggings and hoodies and put on something a little more appropriate for the outside world. If you’re scrambling for something stunning to update your winter wardrobe, we have good news for you! The brand-new LV Pont 9 shoulder bag is Louis Vuitton’s latest embodiment of effortless Parisian chic and the ideal accessory to take your look from drab to fab. Instead of investing in many different items for the season, the Pont 9 does it all with any outfit. “The bag’s refined, rounded design is brought to life in smooth, lightly padded calfskin and finishes with the exclusive Louis Vuitton Circle, a 1930s archive logo reinterpreted by Nicolas Ghesquière, the House’s Artistic Director of Women’s Collections, and used on both the bag’s flap – as a closure – and strap,” says the brand.  <img class="size-medium wp-image-89153 aligncenter" src="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-242x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-242x300.jpg 242w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-827x1024.jpg 827w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-768x951.jpg 768w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-1240x1536.jpg 1240w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-1654x2048.jpg 1654w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-360x446.jpg 360w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder-600x743.jpg 600w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04-LV-Pont-9-shoulder.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /> After months of indoor blues, this piece if luxury is guaranteed to restore your spirits and your style.
