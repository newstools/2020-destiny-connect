One of the best ways to learn about other cultures is through food. It brings people together and can teach us a lot about the heritage that has passed ingredients and dishes down from generation to generation. At the occasion of Africa Day, what better way to open up our minds and discover the delights that the continent has to offer than through food? Here’s a round-up of some of the best YouTube channels to check out for a culinary journey of the African continent. 1.TASTE Southern Africa Based in the cosmopolitan city of Johannesburg, Lorna Maseko is South Africa’s homegrown ballet dancer turned celebrity chef.
