South Africans are known to be a resilient nation, and these last few months have proven this once again. Many of us are struggling to make ends meet and are looking for ways to cut back expenses and save money. “Stats SA recently reported that the unemployment rate has risen 1% during the first quarter of this year to 30.1%, compared to the last quarter of 2019. Analysts predict that this number could increase to as much as 50% due to jobs being cut, working hours shortened and businesses closing as a result of COVID-19. The likelihood is that sadly most families are going to have to find even more ways of cutting back on monthly expenses,” says David Roache, Managing Director of dotsure.co.za. Knowing your financial situation is always important but has now become vital.  Monthly budgets and assessing where you can and can’t cut back will help.  “An idea is to create separate budgets or line items for different grouped expenses. This will allow you to evaluate costs relating to these different spending areas and how you can perhaps cut costs. One of your sections should be for your car, as this is one area where you can potentially save money and avoid any future, unexpected costs,” offers Roache. Dotsure provides consumers with the below tips to help cut back on car related expenses: “Owning a vehicle is costly, with monthly car repayments, upkeep, petrol and insurance,” says Roache, “but there are ways to better manage and limit these expenses.” As schools prepare to reopen on 1 June amid the coronavirus pandemic, parents may have… Hip-hop fans have the opportunity to gamble on tickets to this year’s Castle Lite Unlocks… Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has explained how provincial districts will be assigned a lockdown level,…
